# SuperColliderSuperSynth

This was the SuperCollider Super Synth Project.
In this Project I have experimented with different
Ways of Making Sounds with a Synthesizer.
Modern Synthsizers are hard Wired Systems.
But there are so many different Ways there on
which you can make Music. So you must have tones
of this hard wired Devices. The Solution to this
Is that we can go back in Synthesizer History
there was the Modulate Synthesizers. Up to
today we can have modern Digital Modular
Synthesizers. Supercollider is on way you
can get a Modular Synthesizer on your Computer
or like me on may Laptop. The Script that I 
have presented here is my Version of a 
Uiversal multi Paradigm Synthesizer.
I hope you have fun with this Script,
or better code your own Universal Synthesizer
and let me see.
